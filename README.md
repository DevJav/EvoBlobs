# ðŸ§¬ EvoBlobs

**EvoBlobs** is a project that simulates the evolution of simple organisms in a 2D environment. The organisms are represented as blobs, and they can move, eat, and reproduce. 

Each Blob has its own random initialized Brain, which is a neural network that controls its behavior. There is no learning involved in this simulation, but those Blobs who are able to survive and reproduce will pass on their genes to the next generation with some mutations. The goal of the simulation is to see how the Blobs evolve over time and how their behavior changes as they adapt to their environment.

This project is hugely inspired by [THE BIBITES](https://www.thebibites.com/?v=0ecbf9426bcf) so thanks to them for the idea!

## Roadmap
- [x] Basic simulation with Blobs that can move and eat
- [x] Basic random generated neural network for Blobs to control their behavior
- [x] Basic reproduction and mutation of Blobs
- [x] Basic UI to visualize the simulation
- [] More and different inputs and outputs for each Blob
- [] More complex neural network architecture
- [] Hervivore and carnivore Blobs
- [] Better reproduction and mutation of Blobs
- [] Energy consumption based on movement, brain usage, size...
- [] Better identification of Blobs generations
- [] Better UI to visualize the simulation
- [] Save and load simulation state
- [] Save Blobs
- [] Statistics and graphs to analyze the simulation
- [] Visualize the Brain of each Blob
